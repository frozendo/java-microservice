# java-microservice

Repository to learn about microservices with Java and Spring

The project is software to manage and control all aspects of a school, no matter the level of education.

This is a mono repo, with all the services that make up the application, including front-end and mobile.

Some technologies I use:

> Java 14
> Spring Cloud OSS:
> * Eureka
> * Config
> * Hystrix
> RabbitMQ
> Docker
